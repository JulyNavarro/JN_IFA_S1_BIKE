# JN_IFA_S1_BIKE
The main objective of this project was to test different types of regression algorithms to predict the number of bikes rented. For this, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest were applied.


Nowadays, it is common to see bike-share systems worldwide, and people are getting used to this type of public transport. It works very well to use short duration, contributing to reducing the number of cars on the streets, including pollutants. It is directly participating in sustainable development.
For this reason, this theme makes me attractive to work on a prediction analysis. Also, this data set was chosen considering the domain, the volume of data and the possibility of applying more than one Machine Learning model for our learning and exploration.
For this project, the file Bike Sharing Dataset Data Set, taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository website (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset#), will be analyzed and report all necessary steps, such as EDA, Statistics section, Data Preparation section, and Machine Learning section.
